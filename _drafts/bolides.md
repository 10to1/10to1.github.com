A very fun and innovative project we've been working on lately, is Bolides.

[Bolides](http://www.bolides.be) is a startup who wants to change the way we get access to cars. Instead of having to own one, you share a car with a community of trusted users. You don't have to worry about taxes, about fuel, about parking space, ... They explain their advantages better [themselves](http://www.bolides.be/content/meer-weten) (in Dutch) :)

Once registered, as a user you can make a reservation for a car, find where it's parked, open the doors, and start the engine, all from your mobile phone! No hassle with tedious web sites or finding where the keys are.

10to1 built this application end-to-end: we built both the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/bolides/id599926163?l=nl&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.tentoone.carsharing) apps, and the web backend that powers all reservations.

> As a startup in 2012 we had a big vision, a small budget and hardly any experience in the business of car sharing. At the same time we couldn’t wait to introduce a new way of using cars: why own a car while you have access to several ‘bolides’ in your neighbourhood, to be booked, located and opened by your smartphone! 10to1 allowed us to develop this new culture in short sprints, test on our guinea pigs and come back for the next sprint. Very agile teamwork!
