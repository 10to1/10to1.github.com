Fietshaven coordinates and supplies all kinds of bike services, including bike maintenance and bike fleet management. Their operational staff consists mainly of people who are (re-)entering the Belgian work market, often low-skilled and non-native employees .

Fietshaven wanted to have an easy way to give instructions to their staff on which steps they should take to fulfill a given task, and to have them report on those tasks. That's why they contacted 10to1.

Together, we built a mobile app (with a web application as administrative backend) to do just that.

When a user scans a QR code (generated by Fietshaven), she enters a workflow on her mobile device. That workflow consists of multiple steps. One such step can be an instruction, or a request to report something.

On the backend, administrators can create those QR codes and those workflows. This allows for a very flexible way to create new tasks.

At the start of the project, Axel Verstrael from Fietshaven stated that the app should be very easy to use. He wanted a "Playstation experience": his people should be compelled to use the app, not be forced to use it. Together, we succeeded in creating such an app.
