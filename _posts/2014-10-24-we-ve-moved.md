Ouf. That's been a busy week. So busy, that I even haven't had the time to tell you that 10to1 has moved.

Back in 2011, at our last move, we thought it was important to be reachable by car. What we didn't think about was to be reachable by public transport. Big mistake â€“ a lot of people would like to come to work by train or bus, but that wasn't possible.

So when our lease ran out, we decided to move to Antwerp. We're moving to the old military hospital, which is a nice place to be :)

Our new postal address is

> Hospitaalplein 11<br/>
2018 Antwerpen

That office, however, is currently being renovated. As you can see, we have some serious hacking to do to get things in order :)

So until February 2015, if you want to visit us, you're welcome nextdoors:

> Lange Leemstraat 372<br/>
2018 Antwerpen

We now have a tram stopping at 100 meters from our door, and the train station Antwerpen-Berchem is only 700 meters (or a 7' walk) away. And we have a lot of bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood now. We already feel the new vibes in our office, and it will only get better!
