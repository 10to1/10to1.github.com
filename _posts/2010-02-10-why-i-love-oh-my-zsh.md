If you're a developer like me, you probably spend a whole lot of time in your Terminal window. We all love the power that comes with the shell, but we can get frustrated because it doesn't work quite the way we want it to.

That's why [Robby](http://www.robbyonrails.com/) created [oh-my-zsh](http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/). This is a collection of extensions to zsh, which is a replacement for the default bash on your Mac.

It does a whole slew of nifty things. Case-insensitive auto-complete is one of them. Autocompletion of paths at the remote end of your scp command is another one. But the reason I really *love* oh-my-zsh is this:

That's right. Because I suck at typing.
