10to1 is part of Epi-use since [little over a year](http://blog.10to1.be/general/2013/03/27/business-developer-gezocht/) now. We've spent the last year aligning our businesses. 10to1 is ready to grow its business further in B2B mobile apps.

To support this growth, we're looking for an experienced developer. If you apply for this job, you will be designing, programming and maintaining web and mobile apps. You will also have to coaching junior developers. Together with the project manager, you'll interact with our customers.

We're looking for experience in these fields:

* Programming
* iOS
* Android
* Ruby on Rails
* Agile programming
* B2B applications
* Coaching and mentoring

You would work in a relatively young team, all people who are passionate about their job and who want to deliver the best code possible.

We offer you

* a great environment
* the opportunity to learn from experienced people
* the opportunity to learn from coaching less experienced people
* the opportunity to work on projects from within our office
* an office which is located in the beautiful Groen Kwartier in Antwerp
* an office located on walking distance from Antwerp-Berchem
* benefits
* oh, and a salary :)

The reason 10to1 was started, was to create an environment were people are happy (which was logical at that time, because in the beginning, there were only the 2 founders). We've maintained that mission ever since &em; and this is shared by our mother company EPI-USE. You, too, can enjoy this.
