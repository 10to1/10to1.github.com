As [Kris](http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/devops-ruby-meetup-antwerp-april-8-2010) said it eloquently:

> Devops / Ruby  Meetup  , Antwerp, April 8, 2010
>
> [Joshua Timberman](http://twitter.com/jtimberman) will be in town (Antwerpen that is), for [Loadays](http://loadays.org/). As he is arriving on thursday [Botchagalupe](http://www.johnmwillis.com) suggested we should have a Devops / Ruby get together.

> So I'm dutyfully announcing the Devops/Ruby meetup next thursday april 8th, in Antwerp.

> The plan is to meet up for beers and chatter in our favourite Antwerp geek pub in [Kulminator](http://maps.google.be/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=nl&geocode=&q=kulminator&sll=51.156739,4.423113&sspn=0.024709,0.063858&ie=UTF8&hq=kulminator&hnear=&ll=51.235482,4.413071&spn=0.098667,0.255432&z=12&iwloc=A), Vleminckveld 32, Antwerp, around 20h00 ish.

Joshua is the creator of [Chef](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home), a Ruby-based systems integration framework, built to bring the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure. This is a great occasion to talk with him.

I know the Kulminator, and they have a wide choice of beer there. Make sure to come and say hi!
