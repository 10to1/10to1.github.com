Remember when we [talked](/rails/2009/08/06/working-with-multiple-ruby-versions/) about how to use multiple versions of Ruby on your Mac?

Well, apparently that post is already outdated. Now all you have to do is to install the [rvm gem](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)

I've just tried it, and it works without a hickup.
