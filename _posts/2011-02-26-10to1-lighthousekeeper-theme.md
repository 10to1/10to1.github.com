I recently started using [Lighthousekeeper](http://www.mcubedsw.com/software/lighthousekeeper) to manage my [Lighthouseapp](http://lighthouseapp.com/) projects. I found the app much easier to use than the current web interface. 

But because I didn't like the main layout and they allow you to create custom themes, I created one myself (with a little help from [@maxvoltar](http://maxvoltar.com/)).

You can find the installation instructions on [Github](https://github.com/fousa/lighthousekeeper-10to1-template/).

**Creating your personal theme**

The source files for the 10to1 theme can be found [here](https://github.com/fousa/lighthousekeeper-10to1-template/). It's very easy to create when you know HTML and CSS.

**Now let's get you on the way.**

Create a folder (with the `.lhktheme` extension) in your `~/Library/Application\ Support/Lighthouse_Keeper/Themes` directory.

Inside this folder you should to create a typical index.html file. You can also place some CSS files and images next to it.

And now just design the template as you would with a website. There are also some Lighthousekeeper variables available, just checkout the Lighthousekeeper [Manual](http://support.mcubedsw.com/kb/lighthouse-keeper/themes).

Start!
