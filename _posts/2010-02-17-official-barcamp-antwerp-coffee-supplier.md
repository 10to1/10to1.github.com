It's that time of year again: the sky is blue, the grass is growing, and the air is fragrant with the smell of flowers. The kind of days that leaves most people feelings happy and energized.

Okay, [not entirely true](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=sneeuw) at the moment but it is that time of year, March 6, when [Barcamp Antwerp](http://www.barcampantwerpen.org/) takes place. Always a good day to be had; discussions, presentations, new ideas and coffee.

Since a barcamp isn't necessarily about [anything](http://www.barcampantwerpen.org/index.php/what-the-fck-is-een-barcamp#more102) the coffee better be good. So we've taken the liberty to do just [that](http://www.barcampantwerpen.org/index.php/10to1), enjoy and see you there !

####Note:
Hi ! [I](http://twitter.com/junkiesxl)'m new here, after reading [this](http://blog.10to1.be/general/2009/11/26/ruby-on-rails-developer/) I signed up for the job and am looking forward to "help us develop the most awesome applications".
