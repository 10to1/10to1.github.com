[Wolvenberg](http://www.wolvenberg.be) is a distributor of high-end cycling gear. They sell A brand clothing like Castelli, SealSkinz, fi'zi:k, and lots more.

To maintain a great relationship with their retailers, Wolvenberg sends out a team of 10 account managers. They visit their clients several times per year.

A challenge Wolvenberg was facing, was to keep track of all the information their account managers received. Those people see and hear a lot while visiting clients, but the information never reached the management team.

So Wolvenberg decided to build an app to do just this: help account managers write (short but informative) reports on their visits. These reports consist of a concise text, but also adds information on what the account manager sees in the store: are the Wolvenberg brands displayed correctly? Which ones? And how about the brands of the competitors?

Wolvenberg contacted 10to1, and we built the mobile (iPhone) app and the (web) backoffice system. We took much care to make the app as unobtrusive as possible; a hard requirement was that a report could be written in less than one minute. This starts with selecting the client one's visiting: we only show the clients that are closest to the current location, so it's easy for the account manager to find the correct one. A light and very readable layout makes for an enjoyable experience while reporting.

> De samenwerking met 10to1 verliep erg prettig. Ze begrepen snel wat we wilden realiseren en maakten een goede app die dit weergaf. â€“ Mark Heylen, Wolvenberg
