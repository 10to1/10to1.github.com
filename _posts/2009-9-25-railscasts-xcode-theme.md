I use [textmate](http://macromates.com) for all things ruby, rails, txt, blog, xml, ... and while doing so I enjoy using the [railscasts textmate theme](http://github.com/ryanb/textmate-themes) from [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb). Nice, clean and easy on the eyes.

Since I was never really happy with the standard [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/TOOLS/Xcode/) themes I decided to port the textmate theme to an Xcode theme.  

After days of work, or was it weeks, I got it right. I think.

No really, it just took about 5 minutes clicking around in the Xcode theme editor. [You can find it here](http://gist.github.com/193387).

Enjoy!
