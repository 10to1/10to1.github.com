A couple of weeks ago I watched [the RailsCast on Searchlogic](http://railscasts.com/episodes/176-searchlogic) and saw Ryan use some gem called [Hirb](http://tagaholic.me/hirb/). It looked interesting for sure, so I wrote it down to check it out to completely forget about it. 

Until yesterday.

**What is [Hirb](http://tagaholic.me/hirb/)?**

> A mini view framework for console/irb that's easy to use, even while under its influence. Console goodies include a no-wrap table, auto-pager, tree and menu.

**OK. What does that mean?**

It improves irb's default output a lot. And by a lot, I mean, A. LOT.

In case you like it, you might want to set it up to autoload in `script/console` for all your Rails projects. In order to do so, add the following to your `~/.irbrc` file:

{% highlight ruby %}
if ENV['RAILS_ENV']
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'hirb'
  Hirb.enable
end
{% endhighlight %}
