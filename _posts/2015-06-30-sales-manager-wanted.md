10to1 is part of Epi-use since [little over a year](http://blog.10to1.be/general/2013/03/27/business-developer-gezocht/) now. We've spent the last year aligning our businesses. 10to1 is ready to grow its business further in B2B mobile apps.

We've got a great team of developers, designers and project managers. They do a great job. But they don't sell themselves. That's why we need you – if you're ambitious and able to sell bespoke software.

Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to acquire new customers in Belgium and in Europe. You can rely on Epi-Use's global network. However, you have to be able to build your own sales process. You'll be at the start of a dedicated sales team – a team that will grow in the coming years.

This job is not for the faint of heart. You'll need ambition and you'll need perseverance. But the reward will make it worth it.

Do you feel challenged? Send a mail to [jobs@10to1.be](mailto:jobs@10to1.be) or call Tom at [+32 475 28 17 62](callto:+32 475 28 17 62), and convince us to hire you!
