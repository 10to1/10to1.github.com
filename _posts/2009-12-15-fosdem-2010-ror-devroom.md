For the third time, the Belgian Ruby community is organising a one-day developer's room with presentations
on Ruby and Rails at FOSDEM (6 Feb 2010, Brussels). 

FOSDEM is one of Europe's biggest conventions of people working on Open Source Software. This is a great opportunity to meet the brighest minds in the OSS world!

We're looking for people who want to share their passion about Ruby or Rails.

You can submit your proposal until until Monday, January 4, 2010. For more details, have a look at [the call for papers](http://wiki.rubyist.be/wiki/show/CallForPapers)

Even if you're not presenting, we love to meet you there!
