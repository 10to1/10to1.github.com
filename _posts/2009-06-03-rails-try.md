`try` is one of those small new additions in the [Rails 2.3](http://railsapi.com/doc/v2.3.2/classes/Object.html#M000130) release. Luckily I found out about it via a [Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/152-rails-2-3-extras)

#### What is it?
[From the documentation](http://railsapi.com/doc/v2.3.2/classes/Object.html#M000130):

> Invokes the method identified by the symbol method, passing it any arguments and/or the block specified, just like the regular Ruby Object#send does. Unlike that method however, a NoMethodError exception will not be raised and nil will be returned instead, if the receiving object is a nil object or NilClass.

{% highlight ruby %}
someobject.try(:some_method)
{% endhighlight%}

#### **What** did you just say?
The code above normally throws an exception if `someobject` is nil. By using `try` it just returns `nil`.

Don't overuse this.
