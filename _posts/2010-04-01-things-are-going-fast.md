We all have those periods of time when nothing seems to happen in our lives.

And then, all of a sudden, things go so fast that you're having trouble to understand what's happening.

This is how I feel today.

At the end of last year, we decided to [find](http://blog.10to1.be/general/2009/11/26/ruby-on-rails-developer/) a Ruby on Rails developer. We were psyched when [Piet](http://twitter.com/junkiesxl) told us he wanted to [work with us](http://blog.10to1.be/general/2010/02/15/today-is-the-day/). We've never been more content with an employee.

But after a few weeks, we saw that even Piets addition to the team wasn't enough to keep us up to speed. That's why we couldn't believe our ears when [Jelle](http://twitter.com/fousa) told us he, too, wants to work with us.

He's starting today. 10to1 has been 2 people for more than 3 years. Now, we've grown to 4 in 5 months.

It's awesome.
