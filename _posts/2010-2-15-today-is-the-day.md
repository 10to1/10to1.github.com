Not so long ago we decided [to find someone](http://blog.10to1.be/general/2009/11/26/ruby-on-rails-developer/) to help us develop the most awesome applications.

I'm happy to announce that as of this morning [Piet](http://twitter.com/junkiesxl) is joining us. After today's great start, there is no doubt in my mind we made a good choice.

So, starting today, there's 3 of [us](http://10to1.be)!
