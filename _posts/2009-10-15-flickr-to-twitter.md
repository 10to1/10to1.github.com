Let's assume:

* You have an iPhone
* You love your iPhone
* You have a [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) account
* You want to share your pics by using only one service: [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)
* You have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com) account
* You want to share your pics on [Twitter](http://twitter.com)

Now imagine, you can do all this stuff in one go. Life would be great, no?

Enter [Flickr2Twitter](http://www.flickr.com/services/twitter/). Set it up, and you will love your iPhone even more.
