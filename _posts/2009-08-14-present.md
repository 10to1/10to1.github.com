Speaking of a discovery! [I couldn't have said it better myself.](http://twitter.com/techpickles/status/3195759437)

Just like [Nick Quaranto](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/162185884/stupid-ruby-tricks), I prefer positive conditions. For example, you'll find more `unless object.blank?` in my code than `if !object.blank?`. So I'm very happy that I learned about `present?` today. 

`present?`, the inverse of `blank?`. Heaven.
